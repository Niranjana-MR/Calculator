This works like a standard calculator and doesn't work like a scientific calculator. So, it doesn't follow the BODMAS rule.<br>
For instance: 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 yeilds 42. This is implemented according to SRS (Software Requirement Specification).

That being said, this project doesn't make use of the eval() function as it is very dangerous and should never be used. You can read more about it here: https://mzl.la/3v0uLHu
