# Calculator
This is an on-screen calculator, built to demonstrate my foundation skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
<br><br>
This works like a standard calculator and doesn't work like a scientific calculator. So, it doesn't follow the BODMAS rule.<br>
For instance: 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 yeilds 42. This is implemented according to SRS (Software Requirement Specification).   
<br>
That being said, this project doesn't make use of the eval() function as it is very dangerous and should never be used. You can read more about it here: https://mzl.la/3v0uLHu
